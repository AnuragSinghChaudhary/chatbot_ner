# Setup of Chatbot NER via. Docker
> Note: The docker setup creates no user and uses elasticsearch 2.x in root mode,
> the support for which has been removed since elasticsearch 5.x.
> The code in develop has been changed to support 5.x+ but the docker file has not been updated yet

Following are the steps to create the Docker image and run NER via Docker.

1. Install Docker 

   - Ubuntu:

     ```shell
     $ wget get.docker.com
     $ bash index.html
     # add your current user to Docker group
     $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     ```

   - Mac OSX:

     Follow the installation document: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

2. Pull and run Chatbot NER via Docker use the following command:

   ```shell
   $ sudo docker pull mlhaptik/chatbot_ner
   ```

   > **NOTE**: make sure that nothing is running on port 80 on your server or your local environment. If anything is running on port 80 run the following command
   >
   > `sudo lsof -t -i tcp:80 -s tcp:listen | sudo xargs kill`

   ```shell
   $ sudo docker run -itd -p 80:80 --name ner mlhaptik/chatbot_ner
   ```

   > We have mapped port 80 of the docker container to  port 80 of your machine. Now, on your local machine curl the chatbot api as shown shown below, host can be your local machine or a server IP on which you have been running docker on.

3. To get inside container execute the following:

   ```shell
   $ sudo docker exec -it ner bash
   ```

4. Start the Chatbot NER inside the container

   ```shell
   $ cd ~/chatbot_ner
   $ ./start_server.sh &
   ```

   ​

   Following is the API call to test our service on your local system:

   ```python
   entities = ['date','time','restaurant']
   message = "Reserve me a table today at 6:30pm at Mainland China and on Monday at 7:00pm at Barbeque Nation" 
   ```

   ```shell
   URL='localhost'
   PORT=80
   curl -i 'http://'$URL':'$PORT'/v1/ner/?entities=\[%22date%22,%22time%22,%22restaurant%22\]&message=Reserve%20me%20a%20table%20today%20at%206:30pm%20at%20Mainland%20China%20and%20on%20Monday%20at%207:00pm%20at%20Barbeque%20Nation'
   ```

   Output should be:

   ```json
       {
      "data": {
        "tag": "reserve me a table __date__ at __time__ at mainland china and on __date__ at __time__ at barbeque nation",
